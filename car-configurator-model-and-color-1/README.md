# Car Configurator: Model and Color

# Challenge Description

The app you have to build is a simplified version of https://www.tesla.com/modelx/design.
You can use that website for inspiration if you want, but our API and possible configurations are a lot simpler.
In this challenge, we focus on selecting a car model and color.

## Requirements

- Models and colors must be retrieved from the API included in the project and accessible at the http://localhost:4200/models endpoint.
- Data types are pre-generated for you in `src/app/models.type.ts`
- A `configurator.service` has been started with a Signal that holds all available car models.
- Images for all models and colors can be found at https://interstate21.com/tesla-app/images/
- Complete the `step1.component` to display the right information in the two select dropdowns.
- When a Model and Color are selected, the proper image should be displayed on the screen as illustrated below.
  > ðŸ’¡ HINT: Use Signals as much as possible in `configurator.service` to store the current state of your configuration (selected model, selected color)

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- The project has `mini.css` as a dependency for basic styling.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
