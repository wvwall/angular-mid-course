# Car Configurator: Config Options

# Challenge Description

The app you have to update is a simplified version of https://www.tesla.com/modelx/design.
In this challenge, we focus on selecting a car config and options that affect range, maximum speed, and total cost.

## Requirements

- Update the router config to add routes to http://localhost:4200/step2 that renders the pre-generated `step2.component`, as well as http://localhost:4200/step1 that renders `step1.component`.
- Add router links in the navigation bar to both these routes so we can navigate between these steps.
- Disallow step 2 route navigation as long as car and color aren't selected on step 1.
- Complete `configurator.service` to handle the car configuration and options. Models can have different configs with different prices.
- In the step 2 screen, use the `/options/:modelCode` API endpoint to get the different configs and options available for the selected car.
- The two possible options cost $1,000 each and must only be displayed (not checked by default) when available on the selected car model: yoke steering wheel and tow hitch package. The API has two booleans to indicate whether these options are available or not on the select model.
- When a config is selected, display the associated range, max speed, and cost
- Complete the `step2.component` to display the right information in the dropdown and checkboxes.

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Use Signals as much as possible in `configurator.service` to store the current state of your configuration (selected config, selected options)

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- The project has `mini.css` as a dependency for basic styling.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
