# Car Configurator: Summary and Price

# Challenge Description

The app you have to update is a simplified version of https://www.tesla.com/modelx/design.
In this challenge, we focus on displaying a recap of the total cost of the selected car model and options.

## Requirements

- Update the router config to add a route to http://localhost:4200/step3 that renders the pre-generated `step3.component`.
- Disallow step 3 route navigation as long as car and color aren't selected on step 1 and config is selected in step 2.
- Complete `configurator.service` to compute the car's total price using a computed Signal.
- Complete the `step3.component` to display the right information: Cost of every chosen option (color, config, yoke, tow hitch, etc.) in properly formatted USD prices as illustrated below, as well as the total cost.
- The user should be able to go back to step 1 or 2 and change the configuration, then come back to step 3 to see the updated cost.

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.
- The project has `mini.css` as a dependency for basic styling.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
